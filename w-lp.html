    <p>“Here is the ultimate in a solid body guitar … The Incomparable Les Paul Custom Guitar,” — Gibson catalog, circa mid-1950s
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A brief overview of the guitar</b>
        <br>
        Today’s Les Paul Custom is based on the model from the mid-1950s, but with several modern appointments.
        The body is crafted with a hand-carved maple top, which is fitted to a body made from a solid piece of mahogany
        with strategically routed holes to lessen the weight of the guitar, resulting in a Les Paul with enhanced acoustic
        qualities and improved resonance. The 24 ¾-inch scale length neck is also made from one solid piece of mahogany
        then topped by a 22-fret Richlite® fingerboard outfitted with pearl block inlays and given Gibson’s traditional
        rounded profile. The pickups are Gibson’s 490R in the neck position, which offers the tonal characteristics of the
        original PAFs, and the 498T in the bridge position, The Les Paul Custom is shown in Antique White & Ebony on our site,
        retailers may show Heritage Cherry Sun Burst, Wine Red and Silver Burst, all Les Paul Customs are kitted with gold hardware too.
        Each guitar comes with the standard Gibson Custom case and certificate of authenticity.</p>
